title: BookStack的备份恢复

---
# 关于如何备份和回复

**本文引自[官方文档](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/backup-restore/)** 



While BookStack does not currently have a built-in way to backup and restore content,

it can usually be done via the command line with relative ease.



Please note the below commands are based on using Ubuntu. If you are using a

different operating system you may have to alter these commands to suit.



---



### Backup



There are two types of content you need to backup: Files and database records.



PS. 数据库结构参见[数据库结构](https://iclaud.zicp.fun:1303/books/816b1/page/00411) ，虽然用不上，但是记录下没有坏处。



#### Database



The easiest way to backup the database is via `mysqldump`:



```bash

# Syntax

## Only specify the `-p` option if the user provided has a password

mysqldump -u {mysql_user} -p {database_name} > {output_file_name}





# Example

mysqldump -u benny bookstack > bookstack.backup.sql

```



If you are using MySQL on Ubuntu, and are using the `root` MySQL

user, you will likely have to run the command above with `sudo`:



```bash

sudo mysqldump -u root bookstack > bookstack.backup.sql

```



The resulting file (`bookstack.backup.sql` in the examples above) will contain

all the data from the database you specified. Copy this file to somewhere safe,

ideally on a different device.



#### Files



Below is a list of files and folders containing data you should back up. The paths

are shown relative to the root BookStack folder.



* `.env` - File, contains important configuration information.

* `public/uploads` - Folder, contains any uploaded images.

* `storage/uploads` - Folder, contains uploaded page attachments.

* `themes/` - Folder, contains any configured [visual/logical themes](/docs/admin/hacking-bookstack/#visual-theme-system).



Alternatively you could backup up your whole BookStack folder but only the above

contain important instance-specific data by default.



The following command will create a compressed archive of the above folders and

files:



```bash

tar -czvf bookstack-files-backup.tar.gz .env public/uploads storage/uploads

```



The resulting file (`bookstack-files-backup.tar.gz`) will contain all your file

data. Copy this to a safe place, ideally on a different device.

### Restore



If you are restoring from scratch follow the [installation](/docs/admin/installation)

instructions first to get a new BookStack instance set-up but

**do not run the `php artisan migrate` installation step when installing BookStack**.

You may need to comment this command out if using an installer script.



If you are using a docker-container-based set-up, restore the database before running the BookStack container.

An example of the process using a linuxserver.io-based docker-compose setup can be seen [in our video here](https://youtu.be/6A8hLuQTkKQ?t=1050).



#### Database



To restore the database you simply need to execute the sql in the output file from the `mysqldump`

you performed above. To do this copy your database SQL backup file onto the

BookStack or database host machine and run the following:



```bash

# Syntax

mysql -u {mysql_user} -p {database_name} < {backup_file_name}

## Only specify the -p if the user provided has a password



# Example

mysql -u benny -p bookstack < bookstack.backup.sql



# If using the root user on Ubuntu you may

# have to run the above with root permissions via sudo:

sudo mysql -u root bookstack < bookstack.backup.sql

```



If you are restoring to a new version of BookStack you will have to run

`php artisan migrate` after restore to perform any required updates to the database.



#### Files



To restore the files you simply need to copy them from the backup archive

back to their original locations.  If you created a compressed `bookstack-files-backup.tar.gz`

archive as per the backup instructions above you can simply copy that file to

your BookStack folder then run the following command:



```bash

tar -xvzf bookstack-files-backup.tar.gz

```



If you get errors during the above command it may be due to permissions.

Change permissions so you can write to the restore locations.



After a backup of the files you should reset the permissions to ensure any write-required

locations are writable by the server. The locations required for this can be

found in the [installation instructions](/docs/admin/installation).



#### Configuration (.env File)



During a restore, you may end up merging various configuration options between your 

old and new instance `.env` files, to get things working for the new environment.

For example, it's common to use the old `.env` settings for most things but use database

settings from the `.env` file of a newly created instance. 



One thing to be aware of is that you should use the `APP_KEY` value of the old `.env` file since

this is used for various features like the encryption of multi-factor authentication credentials.

Changing the `APP_KEY` may cause such features to break.



#### URL Changes



If you are restoring into an environment where BookStack will run on a different URL,

there are a couple of things you'll need to do after restoring everything:



- Within the `.env` config file update the `APP_URL` value to exactly match your new base URL.

- Run the ["Update System URL" command](/docs/admin/commands/#update-system-url) to update your database content to use your new URL.



If you migrated web-server configuration files, you may also need to tweak those to correctly use the new URL.
