# Github Jekyller Blog Editor V4

Github Jekyll Editor is extension for Chrome Based Browsers  ([MS Store address][2] / [Google webstore address][1]). Hope to :

1. Support Markdown Editor focusing on Jekyl (hosted in Github.io);
2. Support list posts, edit post, publish post, delete post, etc.;

But due to my personal willing, I hope to seek some new alternative tool which can be much better than my shallow extension, which ideally can support below expectations:

1. Portable & Cross platforms, as I normally switch cross different platforms and devices, especially some of those are restricted to install softwares;
2. As big fan of Vim, Vim-mode in editor is a MUST;
3. Distraction-free mode is perfered;

After scanning all visible candiates, especially several very strong self-hosted solutions (which is most possible approach can easily meet requirement 1), it's sadlly for me to realize that there is not so perfect solution, let alone the self-host solution anyway relying on one dedicated VPS & those effort/trouble shooting in those setup and also customization.

Then, I eventually made up of my mind to reconstruct my **old** tool to be more **mordern style**.

And after some days' effort, there are 2 major updates:
- Update the editor soluiton from previews *Meltdown* to [ace](https://ace.c9.io/) which is so strong web-based editor, and can fulfill all my expectation;
- Add 'Focus Mode' on top of orginal 'Preview Mode';
- Reconstruct the UI and (that might only meaningful for myself and possible developers) the mechanism for theme/UI;

And, some key reuse inputs:

* Markdown Editor : 
	* fork from https://github.com/iphands/Meltdown, thanks,


*  Github simple check/update/create/delete for recent posts:  
	*  mainly got from chrome-app-samples for oauth2 part


Several highlight points:
- For security concern, removed the key.pem file from folder, so, if anyone fork and want to do own development for chrome app, you need to generate the pem file by yourself and use it for publishing (without it, you can't get fixed key for the Github API access);
- Some critical changed on Meltdown code to support cross domain picture display;

  *	Authorization approach updated from Oauth2 to Github Token;
  * UI refinement;
  * Extend the post list from recent 6 to all posts by pagination;
  * Update the fetch logic from sync to async which can ensure the right order of the blog list;
  * Add search function (but not so good for non-Latin as github search API can only recoganize 'full word' ,so in other language e.g. Chinese, Japanese, please well use 'tag' to sort your blog, which can ensure and help searching greatly)
  * Multiple language support added by i18n , now English/Chinese supported.
